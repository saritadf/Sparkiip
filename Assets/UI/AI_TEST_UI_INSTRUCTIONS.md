## ⏱️ Expected Timing

## 💰 Cost Check

Each test costs:

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Please set up authentication" Error
→ Create `GPTAuth.asset` in `Assets/Resources/`

### Nothing happens when clicking buttons
→ Check Console for errors
→ Verify API key is correct

### Always uses fallbacks
→ Check internet connection
→ Verify OpenAI API key has credits
→ Check Console for detailed error messages

### UI doesn't show up
→ Make sure `AITestPanel.uxml` is assigned to UI Document
→ Check Panel Settings is created
→ Verify `AITestUIController` script is attached

## 🔄 After Testing

Once you verify everything works:
1. ✅ AI generates challenges
2. ✅ Sentiment analysis works
3. ✅ Suggestions are relevant

You can integrate these features into your main Sparkiip UI:
- Add daily challenge to Dashboard
- Connect sentiment to Bonsai growth
- Add suggestion buttons to chat interface

---

## 💡 Tips

- **First call is slower** (~3s) - subsequent calls are faster
- **Try different messages** to see sentiment variation
- **Check Console logs** for detailed AI responses
- **Watch OpenAI usage** to track costs
- **Fallbacks always work** even if API fails

---

## ✨ Next Steps

After testing:
1. Read `AI_INTEGRATION_SETUP.md` for production setup
2. Integrate into main Sparkiip Dashboard
3. Create Bonsai visual system
4. Add Firebase persistence
5. Migrate to Cloud Functions before beta

**Enjoy testing! 🚀** If you see challenges, sentiments, and suggestions working, you're ready to build the real features!
