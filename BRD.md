# Sparkiip – Business Requirements Document (BRD)

## 1. Vision Statement
Sparkiip helps long-distance loved ones stay emotionally connected through playful daily interactions, empathy-driven AI, and shared growth systems.

3. Reach 10K organic downloads within 6 months of launch.

## 4. Target Audience
- **Primary:** Immigrants, long-distance couples, and close friends separated by geography.  
- **Secondary:** Emotional wellness enthusiasts, journaling app users, digital nomads.  
- **Demographics:** 18–45 years old, tech-comfortable, emotionally expressive.

## 5. Unique Value Proposition
Sparkiip is not a social network — it's a *private emotional space* where two or more users maintain their connection through empathy-driven challenges, AI reflections, and symbolic growth (like the Cactus and Bonsai systems).  

It blends AI emotional intelligence with game design to make emotional care natural and fun.

## 6. Competitive Landscape

| Duolingo | Gamified learning | No emotional context |
| Finch | Mental health companion | Individual only |
| Longwalks | Shared journaling | Lacks playful feedback |
| Calm | Meditation | Not relational |

- **Eliminate:** Social media noise, generic advice.  
- **Reduce:** Passive consumption of self-help content.  
- **Raise:** Emotional personalization and real-time empathy.  
- **Create:** AI-driven shared activities and symbolic relationship growth.
